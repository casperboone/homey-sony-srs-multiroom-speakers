# ðŸ”‰ Sony Speakers for Homey

This app adds support for a range of Sony speakers.

Currently the app provides the ability to switch between sources and to control the volume of a speaker.

The following speakers are confirmed to be working:
* SRS-ZR5

In theory, all speakers supported by the [Sony Audio Control API](https://developer.sony.com/develop/audio-control-api/#overview-content) should be compatible, however they have not been tested, so do not rely on this.

## Support
In case the app does not work as you would expect, I would appreciate it if you opened an issue 
[here](https://github.com/casperboone/homey-sony-srs-multiroom-speakers), since I do not regularly check the comments
