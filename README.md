# ðŸ”‰ Sony SRS Multi-room Speakers for Homey

This app adds support for Sony SRS Multi-room speakers.

Currently the app provides the ability to switch between sources and to control the volume of a speaker.

The following speakers are confirmed to be working, but others will probably work fine as well:
* SRS-ZR5

## Support
In case the app does not work as you would expect, I would appreciate it if you opened an issue 
[here](https://github.com/casperboone/homey-sony-srs-multiroom-speakers), since I do not regularly check the comments
